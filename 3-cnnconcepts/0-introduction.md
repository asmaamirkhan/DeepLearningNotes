# 🌱 Introduction

> This folder contains **theoric** details about CNNs

## 📚 Important Terms

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 💫 Convolutoin | Applying some filter on an image so certain features in the image get emphasized |
| 🌀 Pooling | A way of compressing an image |
| 🔷 2\*2 max pooling | For every 4 neighbor pixels the biggest one will survive |
| ⭕ Padding | Adding additional border\(s\) to the image before convolution |

## 💫 Notes on performance

* Training speed of a CNN is too slower than plain NN because of its computational complexity 🐢
