# 👀 Visualization of Convolutional Neural Networks

Visualization of concepts explained in [P1](https://github.com/asmaamirkhan/DeepLearningNotes/tree/d20deec6ead832c6650a0d761212dfafef64b302/3-CNNConcepts/0-CommonConcepts.md) and [P2](https://github.com/asmaamirkhan/DeepLearningNotes/tree/d20deec6ead832c6650a0d761212dfafef64b302/3-CNNConcepts/1-CommonConcepts-P2.md) to wrap them up 👩‍🎓

### 💫 Convolution

Applying a filter to extract features 🤗

**Problem 😰:** Images are shrinking 😱

### 😏 Take A Look At Padding

![](../.gitbook/assets/padding.png)

Images Are Too Large, Performance is Down 😔

### 😉 Let's See Pooling

![](../.gitbook/assets/maxpooling.png)

### 🙄 Well, I have an RGB image

Filters must have depth that is equal to number of color channels

### 🤡 Ok, now I want to apply `n` filters

Depth of the output will be equal to `n`
