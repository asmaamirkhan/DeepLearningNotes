## Common Terms


| Term             | Description   |
| ---------------  |---------------|
| Input Layer      |  A layer that conatains the inputs to the NN |
| Hidden Layer     |  The layer(s) where computational operations are being done |
| Output Layer     |  The final layer of the NN and it is responsible for generating the predicted value ŷ |
| Neuron           |  A placeholder for a mathematical function, it applies a function on inputs and provides an output |
| Activation Function | A function that converts an input signal of a node to an output signal by applying some transformation |

## What does an artificial neuron do?
It calculates a “weighted sum” of its input, adds a bias and then decides whether it should be “fired” or not due to an activaiton function
