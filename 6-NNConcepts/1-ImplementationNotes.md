| Vectorization   |  A way to speed up the Python code **without using loop** |


## Vectorization
Vectorization is used to speed up the Python _(or Matlab)_ code without using loop. Using such a function can help in minimizing the running time of code efficiently. Various operations are being performed over vector such as _dot product_ of vectors, _outer products_ of vectors and _element wise multiplication_.
