# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
Improving Neural Networks used in Computer Vision Problems

## Important Terms
| Term            | Description   |
| --------------- |---------------|
| Convolutoin     | applying some filter on an image so certain features in the image get emphasized |
| Pooling         | A way of compressing an image  |
| 2*2 max pooling | For every 4 neighbor pixels the biggest one will survive |

> Result: vertical lines pop out

## Notes on performance :dizzy:
* Training speed of a CNN is too slower than plain NN
