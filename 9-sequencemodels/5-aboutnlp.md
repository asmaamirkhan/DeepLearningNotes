Mixed Info On Natural Language Processing

## 🤸‍♀️ Applications

### 🔠 Neural Machine Translation

* A machine translation model is similar to a language model except it has an encoder network placed before. 
* It is sometimes referred as a _conditional language model_.

### 🕵️‍♀️ Neural Machine Translation with Attention

* If you had to translate a book's paragraph from French to English, you would not read the whole paragraph, then close the book and translate 😅
* Even during the translation process, you would read/re-read and focus on the parts of the French paragraph corresponding to the parts of the English you are writing down 🤔
* The attention mechanism tells a Neural Machine Translation model where it should pay attention to at any step 👩‍🏫

### 🔊 Speech Recognition

* Converting an audio \(x-input\) to text \(y-output\)
  * By measuring air pressure 🙄
* Sequence-to-Sequence model
