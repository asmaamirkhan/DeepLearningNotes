# Common Concepts About Convolutional Neural Networks

## Important Terms
| Term            | Description   |
| --------------- |---------------|
| Convolution     | Applying some filter on an image so certain features in the image get emphasized |


## Convolution Example

#### How did we find -7? 🤔
We did element wise product then we get the sum of the result matrix; so:

```
3*1 + 1*0 + 1*(-1)
+
1*1 + 0*0 + 7*(-1)
+
2*1 + 3*0 + 5*(-1)
=
-7
```
And so on for other elements 🙃

## Edge Detection
An application of convolution operation

### Edge Detection Examples

> Result: horizontal lines pop out

<img src="../res/ConvolutionExV.JPG" width="450"  />

> Result: vertical lines pop out

### What About other Numbers 🙄
There are a lot of ways we can put number inside elements of the filter. 

For example _Sobel_ filter is like:

```
1   0   -1
2   0   -2
1   0   -1
```

And _Scharr_ filter is like:

```
3    0   -3
10   0   -10
3    0   -3
```

> So the point here is to pay attention to the middle row

### Another Approach
We can tune these numbers by ML approach; we can say that the filter is a group of weights that:

```
w1    w2   w3
w4    w5   w6
w7    w8   w9
```

By that we can get -learned- horizontal, vertical, angled, or any edge type automatically rather than getting them by hand.


## Computational Details
If we have an `n*n` image and we convolove it by `f*f` filter the the output image will be `n-f+1*n-f+1` 

### Downsides 😪
1. If we apply many filters then our image shrinks.
2. Pixels at corners aren't being touched enough, so we are throwing away a lot of information from the edges of the image .

### Solution
We can [_pad_](./1-CommonConcepts-P2.md#padding) the image 💪
