### 💫 Convolution
Applying a filter to extract features 🤗

**Problem 😰:** Images are shrinking 😱

### 😏 Take A Look At Padding

Images Are Too Large, Performance is Down 😔

### 😉 Let's See Pooling

### 🙄 Well, I have an RGB image 
Filters must have depth that is equal to number of color channels

### 🤡 Ok, now I want to apply `n` filters 
Depth of the output will be equal to `n`
